<img src="/readme_assets/1.png" width="100%">

</p>

**Screen with chests**

<img src="/readme_assets/2.png" width="100%">

<p>
    Now we have the initialization of 6 chests on our screen. Their number vertically and horizontally can be changed, through the configuration file.
</p>

## How to play

<p>
    To play, we just need to click on one chest, after which it will be opened.
    <br/>
    There are two variants of chests - winning and losing.
</p>

<p>
    Lose chest
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Win chest
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="/readme_assets/win.gif" width="30%">
</p>

**When chest was opened**

<p>
    There are three options for the scenario
    <br/>
    1) The Chest loses - Then nothing happens and the chest just returns to its place on the screen
    <br/>
    2) The Chest winning - Starts a coin drop animation
    <br/>
    3) The Chest bonus winning - Starts a gold bars drop animation
</p>

#### Chest loses

#### Chest winning

#### Chest winning animation

#### Chest bonus winning animation

<img src="/readme_assets/6.png" width="100%">

#### Chest bonus winning badge

<p>
    The animation itself of coins and gold bars falling is generated randomly by duration, by the intensity of the fall, by the speed of rotation of each object. Each object contains several frames, which gives the impression of being three-dimensional.
</p>

<p>
    If you are lucky enough to open the chest with a bonus win you will receive a corresponding badge that says you have won $100,000.
</p>

<img src="/readme_assets/8.png" width="100%">

<p>
    This badge will move to the upper right corner as the animation progresses. Where it will be all the time until the chest run out.
</p>

### When all chests are open - game re-create new chests

    An animation of the appearance of new boxes on the screen will be played.
